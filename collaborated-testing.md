# Collaborated Testing

----

This page will help you to learn some perks of collaborated testing.


## 1. You will be prevented to test a scenario that is already assigned to other

The first scenario here is assigned to `foo@testscope.io`

An assigned scenario is marked by a dashboard/gauge icon. If you tried to test it, you will be blocked by an alert.

Once a scenario is assigned to a tester, the other will not be able to test it. This prevent duplicate effort on testing one scenario, thus the parallel testing and its collaboration will be efficient and time-saving.

## 2. You could unassign the scenario that is already assigned to you.

Let's say that you are in the middle of testing a scenario, but then you want to drop it. You can unassign the scenario by clicking the menu (burger icon) then select unassign. Once unassigned, other tester will be able to pickup your scenario.

## 3. You could test a scenario together with your teammate and credit them in the report

Some times a scenario needs to be tested by more than one individual. Testscope allows you to mention them in the report by select their account as Assistants. Click the menu (burger icon), select "Set Assistants" then select the account that helped you to test this particular scenario.

A scenario that is tested by more than one individual is marked by a people-gathered icon.

# Invite Other Collaborators

----

Testscope allows you to invite your teammates to your project so you could collaborate together, both managing test plan and do the testing themselves. Your invited collaborators will be able to anything you do in your project except one thing: deleting the project. They could delete all of your scopes, scenarios and sessions. So please be aware of this shared responsibilities.

When you guys do testing together, Testscope will prevent the collaborators to test the same scenarios so that you could have a better understanding of each other progress.
